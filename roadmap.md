# Laravel 12 Elementor Style Builder Demo

This document provides a roadmap for setting up a demo project in Laravel 12 with a drag-and-drop page builder similar to WordPress Elementor.

## 1. Environment Setup
1. Install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/).
2. Install [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/).
3. Run `composer create-project laravel/laravel my-builder-demo "^12.0"` to create the project.
4. Change directory: `cd my-builder-demo`.
5. Run `npm install` and `npm run build` to compile frontend assets.

## 2. Livewire Installation
1. Run `composer require livewire/livewire`.
2. Include Livewire scripts and styles in `resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php`.
3. Optionally install [Laravel Breeze](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/starter-kits) for authentication: `composer require laravel/breeze --dev` then `php artisan breeze:install`.

## 3. Builder Component
1. Create a `Builder` Livewire component: `php artisan make:livewire Builder`.
2. In the component view (`resources/views/livewire/builder.blade.php`), use TailwindCSS for a simple grid.
3. Implement drag-and-drop with the [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) `sortable` plugin or with a library like `SortableJS`.
4. Store the layout in a JSON column in the database. Run a migration to create a `pages` table with `content` JSON field.
5. The component should load and save the JSON layout using Livewire actions.

## 4. Basic Widgets
1. Create simple widgets (text block, image block, button block) as Blade partials.
2. Use Livewire to dynamically render selected widgets into the builder grid.
3. Provide minimal styling with TailwindCSS.

## 5. Demo Page
1. Create a demo route in `routes/web.php` to show the builder: `Route::get('/builder', Builder::class);`
2. Allow saving the JSON layout to the database and retrieving it for editing.

## 6. Next Steps
- Expand with authentication and user-specific pages.
- Add more widgets and style options.
- Introduce versioning or templates.
- Optionally explore Vue or React for more advanced drag-and-drop interactions.

This roadmap offers a high-level overview. You can adapt it according to the project's complexity and the chosen libraries.
